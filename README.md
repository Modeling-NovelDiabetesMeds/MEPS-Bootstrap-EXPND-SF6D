# MEPS-Bootstrap-EXPND-SF6D

**Summary**

Here, we develop novel statistical codes to bootstrap weighted AHRQ Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) survey data to incorporate parameter uncertainty around regression equations that predict annual health care expenditures and health-state preference weights based on diabetes, cardiovascular diagnoses, and other individual characteristics.

MEPS comprises of publicly available, de-identified data from a nationally representative sample of families and individuals subsampled from the prior year’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. Each panel consists of two years with 5 rounds of interviews for each individual.

We define the first year as “baseline” and second year as the one-year “outcome” period. For estimation of annual expenditures and SF-6D utility scores, we use multivariable regression analyses optimized for distribution and link function accounting for the survey sampling design.

Medical expenditures and out-of-pocket costs are adjusted to reflect the most recent financial year using Personal Consumption Expenditures Health and Consumer Price Indexes. Generic preference-weighted quality of life (“utility”) scores are calculated from the individual-level SF-12 questionnaire data using the Short Form (SF)-6D health utility index.
